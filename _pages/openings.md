For our positions we look for people who have a passion for problem solving, 
learning, and the willingness to experiment with new ideas and technologies.

All positions are located in Cambridge, MA, USA. 

*Prospective PhD students* If you are looking for PhD positions, please apply to 
the graduate programs at MIT or Harvard. We do not accept any PhD student 
directly into the lab. You have to first be admitted into a program and then 
you can choose to work in our group.

## UROPs

UROP projects. We work through the Quest Initiative for such projects.
