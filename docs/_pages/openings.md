For our positions we look for people who have a passion for problem solving, 
learning, and the willingness to experiment with new ideas and technologies.

All positions are located in Cambridge, MA, USA. 

*Prospective PhD students* If you are looking for PhD positions, please apply to 
the graduate programs at MIT or Harvard. We do not accept any PhD student 
directly into the lab. You have to first be admitted into a program and then 
you can choose to work in our group. We definitely have plenty of projects for 
and welcome rotation students from MIT or Harvard.

*High school students/Citizen scientists* If you are interested in working
with us, please open an issue describing your interests in this GitHub repo: 
https://github.com/sensein/science4all

## UROPs
If you are an undergraduate at MIT, we have several projects that are suited for 
UROP projects. We work through the Quest Initiative or with other faculty for 
such projects. Feel free to get in touch with us.
