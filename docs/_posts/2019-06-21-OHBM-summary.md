Our group participated in several events at OHBM 2019 and partnered on 10 
postsers. Starting with the [ReproNim](repronim.org) train the trainers event 
on June 4th, we spent 9 full days at OHBM. This post summarizes the events. 

#### ReproNim: Train the trainers

During this event we focused on conveying principles of reproducibility to our 
group of trainers, and have them work through developing syllabi that they would
use to improve practices around reproducibility in their home institutions. The
day started with feedback about each of the current training modules in 
ReproNim. Following discussions around existing modules, there were 
presentations covering [DataLad](datalad.org), how to use the ReproNim version 
of the Software Carpentry system to create course materials, and how to 
integrate the materials into the ReproNim moodle platform alongside quizzes. The
participants spent most of the afternoon creating the courses.

Overall, there were a wide array of preliminary syllabi created including 
incorporating these tools into a formal semester long course being designed at 
the University of Arkansas. The plan is to meet virtually with the trainers to 
move these teaching materials along to completion and to teach in their local 
setting.

#### OHBM Brainhack and TrainTrack

The OHBM Brainhack and TrainTrack involved several tutorials and discussions on 
many different projects. From our group, Dorota covered Scientific Testing and 
Docker Containers, and I provided a bit of background on [Heudiconv](https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
as part of Yarik's presentation on [ReproIn](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproin).

In addition to the training events, there were some discussions around 
[Nobrainer](https://github.com/neuronets/nobrainer) (myself), integrating 
TestKraken into AFNI testing (Dorota and John Lee from AFNI), FitLins (Chris, 
Tal, myself), and many discussions and work around formalizing phenotypic information using the [NIDM](nidm.nidash.org)
model (keater.dave, adina, jeff, myself). It was great to make tangible progress
on a few fronts, while outlining next steps for many.
