- title: Vocal and language biomarkers of mental health
  image:
  description: >
    The goal of this project is to observe and analyze vocal variation in
    psychiatric and other neurological disorders and to understand the brain
    bases of such variation. Key questions we hope to answer are: 1) Is voice a
    good longitudinal biomarker? 2) How much vocal information is needed for
    stable tracking? 3) Can linguistic information augment models? 4) Can we
    create a neurocomputational model of such systems?

  description: >
    The goal of this project is to improve incorporation of context in processing
    streams of audio and/or text. This work is being done within Pliers to
    improve features in Neuroscout and also in consideration of spoken or text
    based dialogue systems.

- title: Estimating vocal paralysis
  image:
  description: >
    The aim of this project is to enable a continuous tracker for voice
    (not speech) health. Key questions we hope to answer are: 1) Can voice
    health be tracked longitudinally using a combination of signal processing
    and machine learning? 2) Can a clinically relevant display be built to track
    such voice health? 3) How much individual data is needed to provide a good
    estimate of vocal health?

- title: Imaging genetics analysis of schizophrenia
  image:
  description: >
   This is a collaboration with the <a href="http://genus.mgh.harvard.edu/">Genus
   Consortium</a> to apply multivariate data mining and visualizatin tools to
   the GENUS dataset. An additional target is to support data harmonization in
   multi-site studies. Key questions are: 1) Do multivariate deterministic and
   probabilistic tools provide a more sensitive approach to detecting genetic
   markers of brain structure and cognitive variation? 2) Can a common
   vocabulary help organize and analyze multi-site data?
